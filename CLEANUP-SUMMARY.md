- Removed Storybook scripts from package.json
- Removed Storybook plugin from babel.config.js
- Removed Storybook-related files and references

## Build Fixes
✅ Fixed local build issues:
- Successfully built web application with `npm run build:web`
- Development server running on port 8081
- Production build server running on port 3000
- Verified server response with curl

## Environment Variable Testing
✅ Added tools to verify environment configuration:

3. Verify that the application works correctly in both development and production builds
4. Deploy to your preferred hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
