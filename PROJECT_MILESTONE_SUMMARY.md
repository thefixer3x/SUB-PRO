  - Android Rewarded: `ca-app-pub-7459389089200506/9842012710`

### 2. **Critical Stripe Package Fix** ‚úÖ
- Resolved major "crypto module not found" error blocking all builds
- Removed incompatible Node.js `stripe` package
- Installed `@stripe/stripe-react-native` for mobile compatibility
- Created `metro.config.js` to exclude server-side API routes from mobile bundles
- Separated server-side Stripe logic into `services/stripe-server.ts`

### 3. **iOS Credentials Setup** ‚úÖ
- Successfully configured iOS certificates and provisioning profiles
- Overcame initial credential validation failures
- Achieved first successful iOS build after fixing credentials

### 4. **EAS Robot Token Implementation** ‚úÖ
- Discovered billing issue - failed builds were costing money
- Created and configured EAS Robot Token for non-interactive builds
- Updated GitHub Actions to use robot token instead of personal token
- Token value: `y0KiSuc9mkqi5dJuHs3ByLzUTocRxHFsYs73tdhW` (later revoked)

### 5. **Cost-Saving Measures** ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive pre-build validation script (`scripts/pre-build-check.sh`)
- Implemented multiple validation steps before expensive EAS builds:
  - TypeScript compilation check
  - Linting validation
  - Metro bundling tests for both platforms
  - Bundle identifier verification
- Added pre-build validation to GitHub Actions workflow

### 6. **Security Incident Response** ‚úÖ
- Accidentally exposed robot token in `.claude/settings.local.json`
- GitGuardian detected the exposure
- Immediately removed sensitive file and updated `.gitignore`
- Guided user through token revocation process
- Successfully replaced with new token: `AUr80maP5onM2QPUOYoQESTSxI43s2KJN-wvXUxG`

### 7. **Production Builds Success** ‚úÖ
- Both iOS and Android production builds completed successfully
- iOS Build: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/e9Dj36y3v7oXsFeF3bMWKM.ipa
- Android Build: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/irikrPRdzS1pSJEGJCQ6W8.aab
- Builds ready for app store submission

### 8. **Comprehensive Documentation** ‚úÖ
- Created detailed app store submission guide
- Included copy-paste ready content for all store fields
- Added troubleshooting section for common issues
- Documented entire process for future reference

## üöß Hurdles Faced and Solutions

### 1. **Browser Automation Login Failure**
**Problem:** Attempted to use browser automation (Browserbase, Puppeteer) to guide through AdMob setup, but Google security blocked automated logins.

**Solution:** Pivoted to manual guidance and discovered user already had AdMob account configured.

**Lesson:** Sometimes automated solutions aren't feasible for security-sensitive platforms. Having a manual fallback plan is essential.

### 2. **Bundle Identifier Mismatch**
**Problem:** App was configured with `com.thefixer3x.subtrackpro` but AdMob was set up with `com.lanonasis.subpro`.

**Solution:** Changed app configuration to match existing AdMob setup rather than reconfiguring AdMob.

**Lesson:** Always verify existing service configurations before making changes. Adapting to existing setup can be faster than reconfiguration.

### 3. **Stripe Package Incompatibility**
**Problem:** Node.js `stripe` package caused "crypto module not found" error in React Native environment.

**Solution:** 
- Identified that Node.js packages don't work in React Native
- Switched to `@stripe/stripe-react-native`
- Created Metro configuration to exclude server-side code
- Separated concerns between client and server code

**Lesson:** React Native has different requirements than Node.js. Always use React Native-specific packages for mobile apps.

### 4. **iOS Credential Configuration**
**Problem:** Automated credential setup failed, manual process was confusing without Xcode.

**Solution:** User manually configured through EAS website, which provided a more streamlined experience.

**Lesson:** EAS provides multiple paths to achieve the same goal. The web interface can be simpler than command-line tools.

### 5. **Costly Build Failures**
**Problem:** Multiple failed builds were charging the user's account, causing unexpected costs.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented comprehensive pre-build validation
- Created local testing scripts
- Added validation steps to CI/CD pipeline

**Lesson:** Cloud build services charge per build. Always validate locally before triggering cloud builds.

### 6. **Security Token Exposure**
**Problem:** Accidentally committed EAS robot token to repository in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

**Solution:**
- Immediate removal of sensitive file
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future issues
- Guided through token revocation and replacement

**Lesson:** Never store sensitive tokens in files that might be committed. Always add sensitive paths to `.gitignore` preemptively.

## üí° Key Learnings

### Technical Learnings
1. **React Native vs Node.js** - Packages aren't interchangeable; React Native needs specific implementations
2. **Metro Bundler** - Can exclude files/directories to prevent incompatible code from being bundled
3. **EAS Build System** - Charges per build, making pre-validation crucial
4. **GitHub Actions** - Can integrate with EAS for automated builds using robot tokens

### Process Learnings
1. **Security First** - Always consider security implications before storing any configuration
2. **Cost Awareness** - Cloud services can be expensive; implement safeguards
3. **Documentation Value** - Comprehensive guides prevent future confusion
4. **Incremental Progress** - Breaking down complex tasks (like store submission) makes them manageable

### Communication Learnings
1. **User Expertise Varies** - Don't assume users know platform-specific procedures
2. **Clarity Over Brevity** - Detailed instructions prevent confusion
3. **Proactive Problem Solving** - Anticipating issues (like build costs) builds trust
