## üß™ Testing Flow (Once Activated)

### Step 1: Test Cardholder Creation
```bash
# Using Stripe CLI (replace with real user data)
stripe issuing cardholders create \
  --type=individual \
  --name="John Doe" \
  --email="john@example.com" \
  --phone-number="+1234567890" \
  --billing[address][line1]="123 Main St" \
  --billing[address][city]="San Francisco" \
  --billing[address][state]="CA" \
  --billing[address][country]="US" \
  --billing[address][postal_code]="94111" \
  --live
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "id": "ich_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "object": "issuing.cardholder",
  "status": "active",
  "type": "individual",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### Step 2: Test Virtual Card Creation
```bash
# Create a virtual card for the cardholder
stripe issuing cards create \
  --cardholder=ich_xxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --type=virtual \
  --currency=usd \
  --status=active \
  --live
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "id": "ic_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "object": "issuing.card",
  "brand": "visa",
  "type": "virtual",
  "last4": "4242",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Spending Controls
```bash
# Set monthly spending limit of $100
stripe issuing cards update ic_xxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --spending-controls[spending-limits][0][amount]=10000 \
  --spending-controls[spending-limits][0][interval]=monthly \
  --spending-controls[spending-limits][1][amount]=5000 \
  --spending-controls[spending-limits][1][interval]=per_authorization \
  --live
```

### Step 4: Test Card Retrieval
```bash
# Get full card details (including sensitive data - be careful!)
stripe issuing cards retrieve ic_xxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  --live
```

## üîß API Testing with Your App

### Test Card Creation via API
```bash
# Test your app's virtual card creation endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/embedded-finance/virtual-cards/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "stripe",
    "subscriptionId": "test-subscription-123",
    "userId": "user-123",
    "spendingLimit": 15.99,
    "merchantCategory": "digital_goods_media",
    "userEmail": "test@example.com",
    "userName": "Test User",
    "userPhone": "+1234567890"
  }'
```

### Test Card Listing
```bash
# List cards for a user
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/embedded-finance/virtual-cards/list?userId=user-123"
```

### Test Card Updates
```bash
# Pause a card
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/embedded-finance/virtual-cards/ic_xxxxxxxxxxxxx/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "inactive"
  }'
```

## üìä Real Transaction Testing

### Test with Real Purchases
Once you have an active virtual card:

1. **Small Test Purchase**
   - Try a $1 purchase at a supported merchant
   - Verify authorization webhook is received
   - Check transaction appears in Stripe Dashboard

2. **Spending Limit Test**
   - Set a low limit (e.g., $5)
   - Try to make a $10 purchase
   - Verify it gets declined
   - Check decline webhook is received

3. **Category Restriction Test**
   - Set allowed categories to only "online_services"
   - Try purchasing from a different category
   - Verify decline due to category restriction

### Monitor Webhooks
```bash
# Listen for webhook events during testing
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

Expected webhook events:
- `issuing_cardholder.created`
- `issuing_card.created`
- `issuing_authorization.created`
- `issuing_transaction.created`
