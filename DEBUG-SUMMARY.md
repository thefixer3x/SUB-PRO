# SubTrack Pro UI Debugging Summary

## Issue Identified
The application is showing a blank screen with the following error in the browser console:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'default')
```

This error occurs in the Expo Router entry bundle and prevents React components from rendering.

## Steps Taken to Fix the Issue

### 1. Removed Storybook Dependencies
- Deleted all Storybook-related files and configurations
- Cleaned up package.json, babel.config.js, and metro.config.js
- Reinstalled dependencies to ensure clean state

### 2. Created Debugging Tools
- Added Playwright scripts to visualize the UI and capture screenshots
- Created environment variable testing tools
- Added build analysis scripts

### 3. Identified Root Cause
The issue is related to module resolution in Expo Router when running on web. The error suggests that there's a problem with how default exports are being handled in the bundled JavaScript.

### 4. Attempted Fixes
- Simplified webpack configuration
- Cleaned up babel and metro configurations
- Reinstalled all dependencies
- Created minimal test cases

## Current Status
The issue persists even with a minimal test setup, indicating that the problem is likely in the core Expo Router or React Native Web configuration.

## Next Steps to Resolve

### Option 1: Update Expo Dependencies
Try updating to the latest versions of Expo Router and related dependencies:
```bash
npm install expo-router@latest expo@latest react-native@latest react-native-web@latest
```

### Option 2: Check for Known Issues
Check the Expo GitHub issues for similar problems with the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'default')" error.

### Option 3: Use Alternative Routing
Consider temporarily switching to a simpler routing solution to isolate the issue.

### Option 4: Create New Expo Project
As a last resort, create a new Expo project and gradually migrate components to identify what's causing the issue.
