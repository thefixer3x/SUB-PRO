## Future Extensibility

The current structure supports easy addition of new embedded finance services:

1. **Add new service config** to `EmbeddedFinanceConfig`
2. **Create service component** in `/components/embeddedFinance/`
3. **Implement service layer** in `/services/`
4. **Add feature flag** for gradual rollout
5. **Update subscription UI** to show new service

## Mobile Responsiveness

All embedded finance components are optimized for:
- iOS and Android deployment
- Small screen sizes (320px+)
- Touch interactions
- Safe area handling
- Dynamic font scaling

## Security Considerations

- All card data is encrypted/tokenized
- CVV reveal requires user interaction

- PCI DSS compliance maintained
- User authentication required for all operations

## Analytics & Monitoring

Each service includes:
- Usage tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Error reporting
- User engagement metrics
- Financial performance tracking

This structure provides a solid foundation for SubTrack Pro's embedded finance offerings while maintaining clear separation of concerns and future extensibility.
